# What is TagMo?

TagMo is an Android app for cloning amiibo™ to NTAG215 NFC tags  
&ensp;(including Power Tags, Amiiqo / N2 Elite and Bluup Flask devices)

It was created as a result of the "[DIY amiibo cards](https://gbatemp.net/threads/diy-amiibo-cards.406978/)" thread and all the collaboration that took place in it.
