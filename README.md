# What is TagMo?

TagMo is an Android app which allows for cloning Amiibos using blank NTAG215 NFC tags. It was created as a result of the "[DIY Amiibo cards](https://gbatemp.net/threads/diy-amiibo-cards.406978/)" thread and all the collaboration that took place in it.

# Features:

* Write dump files from legitimate Amiibos into an NTAG215 tag in a way that WiiU/3DS/switch devices will consider to be a legitimate Amiibo with the same functionality.
* Save data of a tag to a file and restore it to the same or different Amiibo/Clone provided they are of the same character/game/series.
* Beta feature: Edit some parameters of a SSB type amiibo allowing you to change special effects, stats etc.

# Limitations:

* Only NTAG215 tags can be used to clone Amiibos. no other type (eg: NTAG216/NTAG213) are supported.
* You will require the key files used in the Amiibo encryption. Please don't PM me about them as I am unable to share them. The thread linked above may help you find them.
* Once you write an NFC tag, it is effectively permanent.  If we rewrite the NFC tag, it will no longer be recognized as an Amiibo.
* **This means that this method can not replace Amiiqo or other Amiibo emulator devices**
* Only android phones are supported.

# Requirements:
* Amiibo Key Files. (See limitations/Don't ask me for these)
* Some blank NTAG 215 tags (Ebay/Aliexpress)
* Android phone with NFC (Tested on Nexus 5 running Android Lollipop)
* Amiibo dumps or real Amiibos which you can copy. (Don't ask me for these)

# Instructions:

## Cloning Amiibo 
* Install the app on the phone as usual.
* Make sure NFC is enabled.
* If this is the first time you run the app. Use the Menu->Load key(s) file to load the key file(s)
* Use "load tag" to load an amiibo dump file or "scan tag" to scan an Amiibo.
* Use "Write Tag (Auto)" and place the phone over a blank NTAG215 tag to write the data and create a Amiibo out of it.

## Saving Amiibo data to file 
* Click "Scan Tag" to scan the amiibo.
* Click "Save Tag" to save data to a file. (A file name will be generated based on the tag details and saved to the download folder.)

# Editing Super Smash Bros (SSB) data  
* Click "Scan Tag" to scan a amiibo. Make sure that the amiibo was once used in Super Smash Bros before.
* Click "Edit SSB Data" to edit properties related to SSB. Using this on non SSB amiibo will corrupt its saved data. requiring you to restore it from a save file (if you have one) or to reset it. It is recommended you backup the amiibo data using the steps above before trying this out.
